# üåê Deploy URL
[https://filmstore-gokbzfw6.b4a.run](https://filmstore-gokbzfw6.b4a.run)

# üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to Run
## Quick Start
Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill the environment variables as needed. It should already work with the default values, but you can change them if you want to.
Make sure you have docker and docker-compose installed on your machine.
Launch docker, then run the following command:
```
docker-compose up
```
This will take a while. It will build the images which are the database, redis, and the monolith website, run the containers, build tailwind files, collect static files, insert admin to database, download the datasets, seeds the database, and finally start the website.
Once it says something like `Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:8001`, you can access the website on [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/). 

## Run Database
If you just want to run the database, you can run the following command:
```
docker-compose up database
```

## Run Redis
If you just want to run the redis, you can run the following command:
```
docker-compose up redis
```

## Run Monolith Website
If you just want to run the backend, make sure both database and redis is running. Then run the following command:
```
docker-compose up web
```


# üìç Used Design Patterns

## Builder Pattern
According to [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder) Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

Builder pattern is used in the APIResponse class. The APIResponse class is used to create a response object that will be returned by the API. This makes it really easy and clean to create a response object. We can chain multiple methods to either set the data, set the status code, set as error, error message, etc. Here is some section of the code that uses the builder pattern:

<div>
  <img src="./images/builder_pattern1.png" width=49%>
  <img src="./images/builder_pattern2.png" width=44%>
</div>

It can be used to easily create a response object. In the image, we chain it into setting cookies when user logged in. We chain it with error message and status code when there is an error. If we're not using the builder pattern, passing everything in the constructor and nulling the unused fields can be really messy and hard to read.


## Decorator Pattern
According to [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator) Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

In python there's a built in way to implement this almost magically. We can use the `@` symbol to decorate a function. This is used in the APIView class. The APIView class is a class that is used to create an API endpoint. We can decorate it with `@protected`, `@public`, `@admin_only` to determine who can access the rest API. We can also decorate the class with the `@swagger` decorator to add the swagger documentation to the endpoint. As for frontend, there's also `@unauthorized` which can be used to redirect user to the home page if they are already logged in. Here is some section of the code that uses the decorator pattern:

<div>
  <img src="./images/decorator_pattern1.png" width=48%>
  <img src="./images/decorator_pattern2.png" width=49%>
</div>

As we can see, we're adding the `@swagger` decorator to the method to add the swagger documentation to the endpoint. We're also adding the `@admin_only` decorator to the method to make sure only admin can access the endpoint. This makes it really easy to add new behavior to the method without changing the method itself. Please note that this implementation of decorator pattern is specific to python. In other languages, we might need to create some wrapper interface to add new behavior to the object.



## Observer Pattern
According to [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer) Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they‚Äôre observing.

Observer pattern is used in some places in the project. One of them are for the database signals when some data is changed to invalidate cache and also in the client side javascript to add a behavior when user clicks a certain button. In django, we can use the `@receiver` decorator to add a function that will be called when a signal is sent. In javascript, we can use the `addEventListener` method to add a function that will be called when an event is triggered. These things are already built in to the framework/language. So we don't have to setup the observer pattern ourselves.

Here is some section of the code that uses the observer pattern:
<div>
  <img src="./images/observer_pattern2.png" width=48%>
  <img src="./images/observer_pattern1.png" width=42%>
</div>

As we can see, the models (database in general) don't need to know how to implement the cache invalidation. It just needs to send a signal to whatever is listening to it. In this case, the cache invalidation function is listening to the signal and will be called when the signal is sent. If in the future we want to do a certain behaviour when the data in database is changed, we just need to listen to the event through the `@receiver` decorator. This makes the code really clean and easy to read. The same goes for the client side javascript. The button doesn't need to know what to do when it's clicked. It just needs to send an event when it's clicked. The function that is listening to the event will be called when the event is triggered. This makes the code really clean and easy to read.

## B01 OWASP
TBD


## B02 Deployment
Everything is deployed with a free service. Here are the services used:
- Database: PostgreSQL 14
- Caching: Redis 7.4.0
- REST API: Django Rest Framework 3.15.2

Website URL: [https://filmstore-gokbzfw6.b4a.run](https://filmstore-gokbzfw6.b4a.run)
Please note that the website will sleep if there is no activity for 30 minutes. So if accessed while the website is sleeping, it will wake up first and can take around 20 - 40 seconds. Please wait.
If using chrome mobile, please update the chrome version to the newest version. It uses the new css unit called `dvh`. If not, it's still safe, it will fallback to vh unit.

## B03 Polling
It's done by making the client do a request. Then the Backend Server will wait until there is new data available. If there is, it will return the data. If until around 30 seconds there is no new data, it will return an empty data and with 204 status code. The client will then wait for a few seconds and do the request again.
Pages that use polling:
- / (Excluding the recommendation)
- /explore (including its search and paginated pages)
- /details/{id}
- /details/{id}/review (including its paginated pages)
- /wishlist (including its search and paginated pages)
- /bought (including its search and paginated pages)

## B04 Caching
This is done with Redis. Result of some database queries that is frequently called will be cached. When the data is updated, the cache will be invalidated.
The caching is done for the following pages:
- / (Excluding the recommendation)
- /explore (including its search and paginated pages)
- /details/{id}
- /details/{id}/review (including its paginated pages)
- /wishlist (including its search and paginated pages)
- /bought (including its search and paginated pages)

You can test this by looking at the print in the terminal. It will print `CACHE HIT` if the data is fetched from the cache, and `CACHE MISS` if the data is fetched from the database. There is also a print of the cache key that is used and the execution time.
Here is an example of the print:

<img src="./images/cache_hit.png" alt="Cache Hit">
<img src="./images/cache_miss.png" alt="Cache Miss">

## B05 Lighthouse
